## Writing
- Abstract package one liner
    - Using the X method, this project tests Y for the puposes of Z.
    - Using the X method, this project tests Y for the puposes of Z, showing that Y is better tested using the A method.

- Abstract package Conceptual Template
    - This project VERBs THING (aims/what the project does)
    - for the purposes of (application, so what who cares)
    - THING is / is important for (background on THING)
        - Definitions, previous research, application problems, issues in industry, etc.
    - However (gap)
    - To address this, I VERBed THING (method)
        - I ran 3 tests with different parameters and then compared the results
    - I found (results)
    - This means that (discussion)
    - Future research should (conclusions and recommendations)

- They say, I say
    - Much of the resarch on _ has shown _, so I studied _.
        - **Much of the research on semantic segmentation of eye tracking data focus on manually coded algorithms, so I studied how machine learning can improve the process.**
    - Because _ research has focused on _, I chose to _.
        - **Because eye tracking data segmentation research has focused on manually coded algorithms, I chose to design a machine learning model that makes the process both easier and more effective.**
    - To put simply, I do _.
        - **To put simply, I utilize machine learning to perform semantic segmentation of eye tracking data.**

- So what, who cares?
    - To better understand _, I asked _.
    - I found _, which means _.

- Signposting Language
    - In this presentation I will explain...
    - So far, I have explained X, now I will tell you about Y.
    - This slide shows...
    - So, what does this mean? It means...

-  Zoom in on specific, technical level - give us the technical details for hte whole picture
    - The current tools and methods are A, B, C. These are not sufficient because E, F, D. I'm developing K, L, M. These should work better because X, Y, Z.
