## Thoughts
- Add chapter in background theory that can be built upon when arguing why it is sufficient to assume that a static environment can be void of smooth pursuit events.
    - The eye cannot fysiologically move smoothly without a moving target.

## VeiledermÃ¸te
- Potential project scenarios wrt. the project as of now
    1. Multi-class classification is implemented and results are trash. Argue why this is; e.g. data labelling quality and/or low sensor sampling rate. Argue results parallell to Zemblys 2016, which also get very poor results for low sampling rates. Is mine better or worse?
    2. Multi-class classification is implemented and results are OK or good. Great! Fine tune machine learning model and write an awesome conclusion about it.
- Make sure to include saccade length and how they are processed in the brain to background theory. This aspect could be very interesting to relate to how humans perceive saccade length. -> It feels instant but the brain has an effect of "deleting" the movements and replacing with predicted images from where one moves his/her gaze.
- If I do not get direct access to information from Tobii regarding post-recorded filtering of eye movement data, it is of great value to the report if I can mention how this affects Osiris. Since the use of commercial eye trackers is directly linked to the reserch question, asking oneself about how this commercial eye tracker processes the data before outputing to us will be of little to no value.
