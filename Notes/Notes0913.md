## Thoughts
### Level of stress determination
- Predict workload in certain situations by eye movement and pupilometry.

## Reading
### Fulh et al. (2021), Fully Convolutional Neural Networks for Raw Eye Tracking Data Segmentation, Generation, and Reconstruction
- Lots of research indicates that the intentions, workload, and attention of a person can be determined by eye tracking data. Worth investigating.
    - May et al. (1990). Eye movement indices of mental workload. 
    - Tomaz et al. (2018). An analysis of the suitability of a low-cost eye tracker for assessing the cognitive load of drivers.
- Challenges of eye tracking applications
    - Reliable classification based on raw data. Has been attempted solved by the introduction of machine learning.
        - Requires preprossessing of data
        - Necessity of annotated data
- Convolutional neural networks a real possible solution for eye movement segmentation.
- Network can be pretrained on existing data sets. DS-SAN.
