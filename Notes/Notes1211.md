## Thoughts
- No PSO in Tobii data, fixations rather seem to have a dampening effect. Result of filtering in Tobii? How? -> Reason for slight sample lag?
- Consider rephrasing "commercial eye tracker". Literature does not make the same distinction, since even the most advanced research-aimed trackers are essentially commercial.
- All advanced algorithms require high sampling rates. Goal of thesis essentially becomes more in terms of being able classify eye movement events even in completely uncontrolled environments; i.e. in the dorm of any old eye tracker user. 
- Rephrase from "static recording environment" to "recording environment with static stimuli"
## Prev Research
### Zemblys (2016)
- Velocity- and dispersion-based algorithms. Binary saccade or fixation.
    - Only effective on a limited range of sampling frequencies.
    - Erroneous behavior with unknown classes. Smooth and PSO.
- Adaptive thresholds?
