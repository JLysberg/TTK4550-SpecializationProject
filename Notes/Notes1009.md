## Thoughts
- Read up on gradient boosting. Need to argue the fact that gradient boosting is the more effective technique for regression and/or classification of a heterogeneous dataset. Compare with techniques that are more efficient for homogeneous datasets, e.g. neural networks.
- Decide whether du address the imbalances of datsets before prediction. Especially for TDT05, where the data set definitely is imbalanced. Test if any methods to address this does indeed improve prediction. Might also be relevant for thesis.
