## Thoughts
- Now that I look at the feature generation of my dataset, I see that a high sampling rate is substantial for some of the most important features used in Zemblys paper. Discuss how this may be much of the reason why they achieve such poor performance with their low frequency dataset.
    - Allow window size to be an adjustable hyperparameter and test performance. Is there an optimal sampling window? -> Should I weight the window hyperparameter somehow for each type of feature?
    - Further work with better eye tracker?
