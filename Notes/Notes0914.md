## Thoughts
- Mental workload can be a measure of several factors.
    - Individual performance
    - Situation
## Reading
### May et al. (1990), Eye Movement Indices of Mental Workload
- Work by Kahneman, among others, support the fact that human performance is  a function of both individual processing capabilities and of task demands. 
    - **"by assessing workload impact on individuals for tasks of constant difficulty, workload indices can be used to determine individual differences in capability and thereby aid in  personnel selection."**
- Indices of workload must be sensitive to variations in task demands produced by changes in task parameters. e.g. game situation for Osiris; skirmish, looting, roaming etc. Indices must also be sensitive to individual differences.
- For measures of mental workload, a system that can eliminate eye blinks in the raw data, and instead include blink frequency as individual data points would be an even more effective measure.

### Palinko et al. (2010), Estimating Cognitive Load Using Remote Eye Tracking in a Driving Simulator
- Cognitive load is measured by either performance, physiological measures or subjective measures
- **Heart rate is an added data source that correlates with cognitive load. FitBit.**
- Physiological measures are obviously very dependent on other factors, such as stress, arousal, exhaustion, physical activity or environmental factors.
- _Look into Recarte et al. [2008]_. Concludes that pupil size can not discriminate between mentally challenging tasks and visually challenging tasks, however blink rate can.
- MPDCR, the variation of pupil diameter is e very powerful metric for cognitive load. This is very promising, as Tobii Eye Tracker 5 only provides reliable measurements of differential pupil diameters.
