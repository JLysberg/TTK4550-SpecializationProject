## Thoughts
- I need to make a qualified decicion on which metric of model performance to use. E.g. Precision-recall, Average precicion, ROG AUC, Cohen Kappa etc.
- Gradient Boosting is shown to be best for heterogeneous data, e.g. tabular data. Find references for this, and write. My case is likely heterogeneous.
