\chapter{Background Theory} \label{ch:bt}

This chapter will present background theory necessary to understand the broad strokes of what is presented in the core of this thesis. Section \ref{sec:bt_TheOculomotorSystem} briefly describes the human eye and its evolution, the muscles necessary for eye movement, and eventually defines the eye movement events that will be used for classification later on. Section \ref{sec:bt_ArtificialIntelligence} takes a passing look at artificial intelligence in general, before diving deeper into classical machine learning and the methods used in this thesis.
