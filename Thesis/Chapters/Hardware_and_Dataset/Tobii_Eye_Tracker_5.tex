\section{Tobii Eye Tracker 5} \label{sec:hwds_TobiiEyeTracker5}

Blinks are represented by momentary loss of data, as well as large noise levels from unpredictable eye movements

No need for head rests for fixed head position, as Tobii ET 5 also tracks head position.

Data is lightly filtered to remove noise. Output data is therefore to be seen as real. Might be cause for data drift.
