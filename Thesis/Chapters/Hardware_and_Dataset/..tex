\chapter{Hardware and Data} \label{ch:hwds}

As was made clear in section \ref{sec:intro_motivation}, researchers have been studying the use case for eye trackers in many applications. As such, their implementations are many, and there are a lot of considerations to take into account when considering what eye tracker to use for what purpose.

This chapter will begin by giving a brief overview of current state of art within eye tracking technology in section \ref{sec:hwds_EyeTrackingTechnology}, how it has evolved throughout the years and what one can expect of the best eye trackers of today. With this in mind, I will argue the hardware choice for this particular project in section \ref{sec:hwds_TobiiEyeTracker5}. Finally, section \ref{sec:hwds_RawDataOutput} presents the output dataset in its raw form, building up to the next chapter, where we will describe the methods with which the dataset is further labelled.
