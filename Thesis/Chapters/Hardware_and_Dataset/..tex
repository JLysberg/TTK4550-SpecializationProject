\chapter{Hardware and Data} \label{ch:hwds}

% As made clear in section \ref{sec:pr_EyeTrackingResearch}, researchers have been studying the use case for eye trackers in many applications. As such, their implementations are many, and there are a lot of considerations to take into account when considering what eye tracker to use for what purpose.

% This chapter will begin by giving a brief overview of the current state-of-the-art within eye-tracking technology in section \ref{sec:hwds_EyeTrackingTechnology}, how it has evolved throughout the years and what one can expect of the best eye-trackers of today. With this in mind, the author will argue the hardware choice for this particular project in section \ref{sec:hwds_TobiiEyeTracker5}.
