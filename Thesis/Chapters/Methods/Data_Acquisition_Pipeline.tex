Data gathered from Tobii ET5 is processed through a 3-step pipeline, as illustrated in figure \ref{fig:meth_DataAckPipeline}. This \textit{Data Acquisition Pipeline} is required to go from a raw data stream of eye-tracking data to a dataset ordered by timestamps, labeled, and ready for classification. Each step will be detailed further in the following sections.
