\section{Towards Machine Learning} \label{sec:pw_TowardsMachineLearning}

Although this thesis aims to implement a machine learning model which can compete with the traditional practices mentioned above, it is by far not the first to attempt so. Usually with great

- Failed to test on inexpensive commercially available eye tracker.
    - Tried to simulate such eye trackers by reducing sampling rate, but the model was still trained on datasets with larger sampling rates so this was a futile venture.
