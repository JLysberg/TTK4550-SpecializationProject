\chapter{Introduction} \label{ch:intro}

%In this thesis, I explore the use of state of the art eye tracking technology to gather valuable information from users in an interactive gaming environment. \marginpar[]{Trenger jeg dette avsnittet, eller blir det un√∏dvendig fyll og gjentakelse av abstract?} This information is analysed with a particular focus on applied machine learning, and will in turn be compared with traditional methods of manual coded algorithms. Eye tracking in an interactive as opposed to a static environment introduces significant challenges when certain eye movement events are to be classified. Additionally, the capabilities and limitations of eye tracking hardware will be detailed in brief.

This project is a research collaboration with Osiris Performance Analytics AS, a start-up company working with eye tracking to deliver user-specific feedback to video game players. Through this project, we hope to conclude whether a method for eye tracking data classification has any commercial value in the field of eSports competitive performance analytics.

This introductory chapter provides an overview of the state of affairs within eye tracking, opening by discussing my personal motivation for applying myself to this particular field of research (section \ref{int_motivation}). The motivation section serves as a foundation for a series of research questions (section \ref{int_research}), before following up with the overall thesis structure (section \ref{int_thesis}).
