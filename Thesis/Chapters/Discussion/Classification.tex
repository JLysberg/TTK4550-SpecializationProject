\section{Classification} \label{sec:disc_Classification}

Looking at section \_, it can further be observed that even with a limited supply of decently labeled data sets, we can train multiple models that surpass the classification accuracies of \_ algorithm in the binary classification problem. Even concerning multi-class classification, some of our models perform well given the underlying data. 

\subsection{Model Improvements}
While the models presented do solve our initial problem of eye event classification, they are likely not even close to the most optimal given the classification problem. Sadly, I did not research the prospects enough to implement such a model. Some solutions come to mind, however. For instance, one particular shortcoming of using a classical machine learning model is the need for manually designed features. As described in section \ref{sec:meth_FeatureGeneration}, all features used for classification are selected by an educated assumption of its inherent correlation with eye movement. However, an educated assumption is still merely an assumption, so 
the model would likely significantly improve if it generated its features as a set of hidden layers in a neural network.
